### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have enough storage space on your device to download and install the app.

### Download
- Go to the Google Play Store and search for Toolz or click on the link below:

   <a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.prime.toolz2&pcampaignid=pcampaignidMKT-Other-global-all-co-prtnr-py-PartBadge-Mar2515-1'><img alt='Get it on Google Play' src='https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges/static/images/badges/en_badge_web_generic.png' width="256"/></a>
   
- Tap on the Install button and wait for the app to download and install on your device.
- Once the installation is complete, you can launch the app from your home screen or app drawer.

## Build and run the project
If you are a developer and want to build and run the Toolz app from the source code, you need to follow these additional steps:

### Prerequisites
- Install Android Studio Alpha (Hedgehog) or above on your machine. You can download it from here: https://developer.android.com/studio/preview
- Install Git on your machine. You can download it from here: https://git-scm.com/downloads

### Steps
To build the Toolz app, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: Open a terminal window and type the following command: `git clone https://github.com/prime-zs/toolz2.git`
2. Add the private file:

Some features and functionalities of the app require a private file that contains some keys and ids. To add this file to the project, do the following:

- Create a file named `Private.kt` in the package `com.prime.toolz.core.billing`.
- Paste the following code into the file:

```kotlin
package com.prime.toolz.core.billing

object Private {
    /**
     * Base64-encoded RSA public key to include in your app binary
     */
    const val PLAY_CONSOLE_PUBLIC_KEY = "replace_this_with_id"
    const val UNITY_APP_ID = "replace_this_with_id"
}

object Product {
    const val DISABLE_ADS = "replace_this_with_id"
}

object Placement {
    const val INTERSTITIAL = "replace_this_with_id"
    const val BANNER_SETTINGS = "replace_this_with_id"
    const val BANNER_UNIT_CONVERTER = "replace_this_with_id"
}
```
Note: Replace the placeholders `replace_this_with_id` with the appropriate values for your app. You can get these values from the Play Console, Unity Dashboard, or other sources.

3. Open Android Studio and select Open an existing project.
4. Navigate to the folder where you cloned or downloaded this repository and select it.
5. Wait for Android Studio to sync the project and resolve the dependencies.
6. Run the app on an emulator or a connected device by clicking the Run button.

You have successfully built and run the Toolz app from the source code. Enjoy!
